# FriendoQuizz
FriendoQuizz is a simple Android game to play at parties.
Goal is simple: A question is asked, people vote at the same time yes or no and the minority gets punished. Don't drink too much though. ;)

# Development
I use the game engine Unity and I develop on Visual Studio Code.
Languages used: C#, PHP and SQL.
